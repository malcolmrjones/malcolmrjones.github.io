        Greetings! My name is Malcolm Jones and welcome to my website. I am currently studying computer science at North
        Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. Computer science and tech has always been a passion of mine.
        I enjoy learning about new technologies and building great software. One of my favorite events to attend are
        hackathons. Hackathons allow me the chance to meet new people, learn new things, and work on new projects. I am
        also currently serving as Vice-President of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter at NC A&T. ACM
        is a great organization that has exposed me to a community of great people and great opportunities. When I am
        not busy with my academics I enjoy spending time with friends, being out in nature, reading, cooking, and
        watching my favorite series.
